        <h2 class="types">White Tea</h2>
        <p align="justify">White Tea is essentially unprocessed tea. 
          The name is derived from the fuzzy white base that appears on unopened or recently opened tea buds
          ,the newest growth on the tea bush. 
          White tea is plucked & allowed to wither & dry. 
          If the weather isn't co-operating, the leaves may be put into a gentle dryer on a very low heat to assist.
           but the leaves are not rolled, shaped. <br><br>Some minimal oxidation does happen naturally to the leaves due to the fact that, 
           it takes a full day or two to air dry the tea leaves. This is why some white teas, like the classic White Peony, 
           show leaves of differing colors like brown, green and white. 
          White teas produce very pale green or yellow liquor and are the most delicate in flavor and aroma.</p>

          <img src="images/tea2.png" height="300" width="350" alt="Green Tea" align="center">
          <h2 class="types">Green Tea</h2>
          <p align="justify">Green Tea has a procedure of being plucked, withered & then rolled. 
            It is not oxidized because during the rolling process,heat is applied during the process. 
           For green tea, fresh leaves are either steamed or pan fired to provide a temperature hot enough to stop the 
           enzymes from browning the tea leaf.<br><br>
           Just like blanching vegetables. Simultaneously, the leaves are shaped by curling with fingers, 
           pressing into the sides.The leaves are then rolled & swirled countless shapes have been created, each with a different endemic taste.<br><br>
           The leaves are then given their final fire to fully dry them and then they are done. 
           The liquid of green tea is typically yellow or green in color,
            & flavors range from fresh steamed greens to toasty & grassy like astringency.</p>

          <img src="images/tea3.png"  height="300" width="350" alt="Oolong Tea" >
          <h2 class="types">Oolong Tea</h2>
          <p align="justify">Oolong Tea is known as 1 of the most time consuming type of teas to produce. 
            It utilizes all the 5 basic steps, with oxidizing and rolling done repeatedly.<br><br> 
            This tea is complex category because it is so broad.
             it's most simply described as a half of green and black tea, 
             &that's quite accurate when we see the characteristics of it . 
            These teas are anywhere from 8% to 80% oxidized.
            First the leaves are rolled, then allowed to rest & oxidized for a while,then they will be rolled again & then oxidized,again and again.
            Often gentle heat is applied to slow the enzymes down a bit in the leaves. Over the course of many days and sometimes also hours. 
            The end product is a beautiful layering of aroma and flavor. Oolongs typically have much more rich and beautiful 
            flavor than green tea and white tea, 
            with very smooth, soft & rich in floral & fruity flavors.<br><br>
            Because of their smooth yet rich profiles, Oolong tea are ideal for those who are new to tea drinking.</p>

          <h2 class="types">Black Tea</h2>
          <p align="justify">
            Black Tea also utilizes all five basic steps, but is allowed to oxidize more completely. 
            Also, the steps are followed in a very linear form,they are generally not repeated on a single batch. 
            The tea is completely made within one day. 
            The brewed liquor of a Black tea ranges colors between Dark brown & pale Red.<br><br>
             Black teas offer the strongest flavors & in some cases, the greatest of astringency. 
             Black teas are the only and most type of tea whihc is consumed with sugar & milk. 
            It is also a most popular base for Iced tea.</p>

          <h2 class="types">Pu'erh Tea</h2>
          <p align="justify">A completely different art of tea. 
            It first undergoes a process similar to Green tea, but before the leaf is first dried & 
            it's aged either as loose-leaf tea or pressed into dense cakes. 
            Pu'erh is a fermented tea <br><br>
            Depending on the type of pu'erh being made (there are 2 types :Ripe & Raw), the aging process lasts anywhere from a month or two to 
            many years. The more time it gets richer and better in taste.
            Very old,pu'erhs are called living teas like wine.<br><br> 
            Pu'erh tea is well known for their earthy, woodsy or musty aroma and rich, smooth taste.</p>

  <h2 class="types">Chocolate Tea</h2>
  <p align="justify">Most chocolate and cocoa teas are made by mixing roasted and winnowed cacao shells with regular black tea. 
    The cacao shells infuse the brewed tea with chocolate-y flavor without the calories of regular cocoa.<br><br>
    Don’t drink it expecting cocoa, but chocolate tea makes a decent beverage in its own right. 
    The ones we’ve tried have been mild, pleasantly sweet, and especially good with a splash of milk. For us, 
    much of the chocolate experience seems to be more in the aroma than the actual flavor.</p>
