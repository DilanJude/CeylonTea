      <p align="justify">Every day thousands of people in over thirty two countries enjoy the flavours of the tea we produce. 
        Over 100 years ago, the company that was eventually to become Anverally & sons (Pvt.) Ltd., 
        was founded by a man with a vision. This man was my great great grandfather Mr. Anverally. 
        His vision was to establish the island of Sri Lanka as a major exporter of some of the finest pure teas to the rest of the world.<br>
        A century later, his vision has been made a reality by his successors.
         Today Anverally and Sons (Pvt.) Ltd., is still very much a family concern and exports some of the finest teas in the world to 32 countries in Europe,
          Asia, CIS States, and the Middle East. With close connections to a number of plantation companies and tea estates around the island, 
          Anverally & Sons have some of the most experienced tea tasters, vital for the important process of blending that makes Ceylon Tea so 
          famous around the world today.<br>
        We do provide private labels and bulk tea to buyers, 
        we have always matched the right quality which our customers required.
         We do the packaging, graphic design for your requirement. 
         We have been supplying Ceylon Tea for buyers since 1890. <br><br> - CEO Anverally & Sons PVT LTD- </p>

      <p align="justify">We believe in reflecting our love for tea into every other aspect of our business too. 
        We love keeping our environment natural and our people happy.
         It is our commitment to be green and ethical in business. 
        That is why at Amazon Teas, we only buy organic produce and that too, only grown by small farmers, our Superheroes. 
        Our delicate quantities of fresh organic produce carry with them all the goodness of Mother Earth. 
        The art of Tea farming practiced by the small plantation Superheroes involves a meticulous method 
        of maximizing produce without the use of chemical fertilizers, thus maintaining the natural
         vibrancy of the soils. More impressively, our Superheroes minimize their
         carbon footprint through active erosion prevention and waste management to ensure the sustainability of our planet.
         And for their admirable work,
         it is only fair that we pay them a premium on top of the Fair-trade price for their produce. Now, with each new season, 
        the farmers are super excited to farm more and more organic.
         All this nature-love and freshness transcends across the business and reinforces our first and foremost priority; 
        the well being of everyone. This includes our resourceful planet,
         our suppliers and most importantly, our Tea lovers. <br><br> - CEO Amazon Pvt LT- </p>
