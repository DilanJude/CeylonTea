  <h3 class="paras">What is Ceylon Tea & Why ?</h3>
  <h2 class="paras"><div class="hashtag"><b>Blessed with Morning Dew and straight to the Brew</b></div></h2>
  <div class="paras3">
    <p>Known as Ceylon until 1972, the island Sri Lanka lies a mere 19 miles from the southern coast of India. Blessed with ideal trade winds and geographic diversity, the humid, tropical climate is offset by mountains in the south rising to altitudes of over 8,000 feet. Today, Sri Lanka is the world's fourth largest Tea producer & its famous leaves (still called "Ceylon") are cherished for their consistent quality & taste.</p>
      <ul>                                                                                      <!-- Numbered List -->
      <li>Tea grown & manufactured entirely in Sri Lanka which conform strict quality standards laid down and administered by the<br><b>Sri Lankan Tea Board</b>.</li>
      <li>Meeting the above criteria makes the Tea eligible to bare the branding of <b>The Lion symbol of Ceylon Tea</b>.</li>
      <li>Ceylon Tea unlike other Tea , is a Tea worth putting your kettle on for.</li>

  <div class="paras1">
    <ol> <!-- Unordered List -->
      <li>James Taylor arrived to Sri Lanka(then Ceylon)in 1852,settling down at the Loolecondera Estate located in 
      Galaha. Then he begins to plant tea in the 19-acre land on the Loolecondera Estate(1857), unknowingly
      laying the foundation for Sri Lankaâ€™s largest export industry in the years to come.</li>
      <li>After the success of the Tea plantation he equipped a tea factory & began operating on the Estate in the year 1872.</li>
      <li>In the year of 1873, Ceylon Tea made it's first international debut when 23lbs of tea produced by James Taylor reached the city of London.</li>
      <li>With the Sirocco Tea dryer in the year 1877 & the tea-rolling machine in 1880, commercial tea production was now viable in Sri Lanka(then Ceylon).</li>
    
    <p>  <!--Paragraph 1 and Unordered List -->
      <li>During the 1880s, tea production in Sri Lanka grew rapidly with planters from all over the hill country visiting Loolecondera to learn the basics of 
      manufacturing & growing Ceylon tea. In 1891, Ceylon Tea was sold at the London tea auctions at an astonishing price of LKR 36.15 per lb.In 1892 James Taylor died at the age of 57 keeping
    behind the legacy of being the Pioneer of the tea industry in Ceylon.</li></p>
    <p><!--Paragraph 2 and Unordered List -->
      <li>The years 1897-1907 witnessed a great significance in the production of Tea.
      By 1899 tea was cultivated in nearly 400,000 acres of Land. At the heat of this time by 1915 Mr.Thomas Amarasuriya was
      appointed as the first Sri Lankan Chairman of the Planters Association.
      By this time Ceylon was producing atleast 100,000 tons worth of tea for export only, because of that
      the Tea research institute was setup in 1925 to further improve production and maximize profits.</li>

        <p><!--Paragraph 1-->
        <li>Sri Lanka is a unique country because the tropical climate allows for continual, year round harvesting. The beautiful island has striking micro climates which are ideal for tea production. Tea in Ceylon are classified by their elevations : low , medium and high grown. Each is unique , creating remarkable variety for a country which produces exclusive black tea.</li></p>
        <p><!--Paragraph 2-->
        <li>The Srilankan government is heavily involved in grading standards and production quality of commercial farms. The Sri Lanka Tea Board performs rigorous inspections of "Ceylon Tea" which bare the Lion Logo.</li></p>

          <h3 class="paras" >Notable Sri Lankan Teas</h3>
          <ul>
          <p><li>Pahata Rata "Low Country" (Sea Level-2,000 ft) Teas grown in the plains and foothills of Sri Lanka produce full bodied, colorful and hearty cups of tea, perfect for cream and sugar. The leaves are often larger, fuller and more wiry in appearance.</li></p>
          <p><li>Medarata "Midland" (2,000-4,000 ft) - Like James Taylor's very first tea garden at Loolecondera, these medium-altitude teas tend towards the medium and full bodied with a refreshing citrusy tang, brisk fruity notes and balanced astringency. Our Ceylon Sonata (from Taylor's Kandy region) is a classic example of this well-loved tea type.</li></p>
          <p><li>Udarata "High Country" (over 4,000 ft) The higher elevation teas from Uva, Dimbula and Nuwara Eliya can resemble a Darjeeling with their golden liquors and fresh, sweet aromas. The colorful dry leaf can even appear similar to the autumn hues of Himalayan teas. Like most Ceylons, these lean more toward a citrus note than muscat grape, the signature of a Darjeeling. Pleasantly crisp, medium bodied and floral - the perfect afternoon cup of tea.</li></p>
